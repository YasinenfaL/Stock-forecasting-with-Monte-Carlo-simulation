# Stock Price Prediction with Monte Carlo Simulation

This project allows predicting a stock price with a Monte Carlo simulation using Python. It downloads historical stock price data, performs a Monte Carlo simulation on that data, and visualizes the results graphically.

## Features

- Downloads stock data using Yfinance API.
- Simulates possible price predictions with Monte Carlo Simulation.
- Visualizes results graphically using Plotly.
- Shows the distribution of simulated prices by running 1000 simulations.

## Requirements

- **Docker**: You can run the project in a Docker container.
- Alternatively, you can run it in a local environment using the following Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `yfinance`
  - `scipy`
  - `plotly`
